**Note:** This project is **not** ready for full usage. Please refrain from usage on public plots until 1.0.0. This is because syntax is constantly changing and new systems are being added and removed. Also, this project is meant for use on a Minecraft server known as DiamondFire. This won't be very useful to you if you don't play on it.

RustFire is a project coded in Rust. It allows users to create DiamondFire code templates through the use of the Rust programming language. 

# Rust Programming Language
Since I know a lot of DiamondFire players don't know what Rust is or how to install it, I'll give a quick overview.

Rust is a programming language that compiles to an executable. It's primary feature that I use here are macros - essentially code that generates more code. It also has a borrow checker system, with the following general rules:

> The borrow check is Rust's "secret sauce" â€“ it is tasked with enforcing a number of properties:
> - That all variables are initialized before they are used.
> - That you can't move the same value twice.
> - That you can't move a value while it is borrowed.
> - That you can't access a place while it is mutably borrowed (except through the reference).
> - That you can't mutate a place while it is immutably borrowed.
> 
> From the Rust Compiler Development Guide
  
It sounds very complex, I know. It's a bit hard to wrap your head around. Unless you implement Rust code with your DiamondFire code, you won't have to worry about it.

## Installation
Installing Rust is a bit strange. Follow the instructions on [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Project Setup
Once the Rust Compiler is installed, at this point, I recommend you install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and the [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) VSCode plugin.
After that, create a new folder and open it up in VSCode. Press Ctrl + Shift + \` to open a terminal. Once you're in there, type 'cargo init'. It will initialize a new Rust project in your current directory.

# Installation of RustFire
Once your project is setup, you can either type the following into your command prompt:
```
cargo add rustfire
```
or add the following to your cargo.toml:
```toml
[dependencies]
rustfire = "0.2.0"
```
Dependencies of this will be installed automatically.

After this, you will want to install Python 3 (if you don't have it already) and add the following to the root directory of your project. This file should be called `send.py`:
```py
import socket
import sys
import json

sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

try:
    # Connect to server and send data
    sock.connect(("localhost", 31372))
    sock.sendall(bytes(sys.argv[1],encoding="utf-8"))
finally:
    sock.close()
```
This code opens a socket on 31372 for RustFire to send templates through. This will later be implemented as base into RustFire and this step will be removed when that happens.

# Usage
Here is a basic program written in RustFire.

```rust
// Import Boilerplate for RustFire. Recommended in all projects to minimize boilerplate.
use rustfire::*;
use rustfire::build::build::{BuildFlags, rf_build_flags};
use rustfire::types::item::Item;
use rustfire::build::build::build;

// Code to be ran. This is usually split into multiple functions.
fn main() {
    // build flags so the RustFire compiler knows things
    rf_build_flags(BuildFlags {
        template_name: "Join with Parameters"
    });
    player_event!(Join); // join event
    target!(AllPlayers); // change targeting to all players
    player_action!(SendMessage Item::Text("&a%default &7has joined!")); // send message to all players
    target!(Default); // change targeting to default / none
    function!(CallParams "PVPKit", Item::Text("StandardKit")); // call function with parameters
    build(); // build function
}
```
